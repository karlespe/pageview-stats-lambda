<h3><u>Cubana de Aviación Flight 972</u></h3>

<p>Cubana de Aviación Flight 972 (CU972/CUB972) was a scheduled domestic flight from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mart%C3%AD_International_Airport">José Martí International Airport</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana">Havana</a>, to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Pa%C3%ADs_Airport">Frank País Airport</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holgu%C3%ADn">Holguín</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba">Cuba</a>, on May 18, 2018. The 39-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737#737-200">Boeing 737-201 Adv.</a> flying the route crashed shortly
after takeoff, near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_de_las_Vegas">Santiago de las Vegas</a>, 19 kilometres (12 mi) from Havana city centre. Of those on board,
112 died and one passenger survived with critical injuries.[8] Three of the victims initially survived the crash but later
died in hospital.</p>

<p>The site was visited by prominent officials soon after the crash, followed by a call for mourning and flags to be flown at
half-mast. Most of the victims were Cuban. The United States offered to help Cuban authorities investigate the crash.
This was accepted, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<h3><u>Aircraft</u></h3>

<p>The aircraft was a leased Boeing 737-201 Adv. aircraft, operated by Mexican charter airline Global Air (Aerolíneas Damojh, S.A. de C.V.), on a scheduled domestic flight from Havana to Holguín on behalf of Cubana de Aviación. The aircraft was manufactured in July 1979, was about 39 years old and had served with multiple airlines before it was acquired by Global Air in 2013.</p>

<p>A statement by Global Air said that its aircraft had passed a November 2017 Mexican government inspection and that it was up-to-date with its permits to operate and lease aircraft.</p>
